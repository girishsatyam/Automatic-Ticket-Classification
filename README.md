# Automatic Ticket Classification using NLP and ML

For a financial organization, customer complaints serve as valuable feedback, revealing areas where products and services may be falling short. Prompt and effective resolution of these complaints not only minimizes customer dissatisfaction but also fosters loyalty and trust. Moreover, it enables the company to continuously enhance its offerings and attract a broader customer base.

As the company scales and its customer volume increases, manually reviewing and routing each support ticket to the appropriate department becomes increasingly time-consuming and inefficient. This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) can play a pivotal role.

This project focuses on automating the customer support ticket handling system for a financial firm by leveraging NLP and ML techniques. The objective is to accurately analyze and classify support tickets based on their content, ensuring they are directed to the correct team for faster and more effective resolution.

In this case study, you will take on the role of an NLP engineer at a financial company aiming to automate its customer support ticketing system. The company offers a wide range of products and services, including credit cards, banking, and mortgages or loans. Customer complaints often highlight weaknesses in these offerings, making their timely and efficient resolution essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, since these complaints are typically in the form of unstructured text, companies have traditionally relied on teams of support staff to manually review and route each ticket to the appropriate department.

## Solution

To automate the customer support ticket system, we will use NLP techniques to process and analyze the text data. We will apply ML algorithms to classify support tickets based on their content and assign them to the relevant team. The ML component of this project utilizes a powerful algorithm that predicts the ticket's category based on the content of the ticket, achieving high accuracy rates.

## Features

- Automatic ticket classification using NLP and ML algorithms
- Accurate identification and categorization of support tickets
- Efficient assignment of support tickets to the relevant team for swift resolution
- Comprehensive documentation and step-by-step guide for using and integrating the system with existing support workflows
- Open-source codebase for customization and enhancement of the system to fit specific needs.

## Model Evaluation Metrics


- Accuracy: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
- Precision: The proportion of true positives among the total number of cases predicted as positive.
- Recall: The proportion of true positives among the total number of actual positive cases.
- F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- ROC AUC Score: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which measures the performance of the model at different classification thresholds.

Based on these metrics, the Logistic Regression and XGBClassifier models performed the best, with high accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. 

## Technologies

- Python
- Natural Language Processing
